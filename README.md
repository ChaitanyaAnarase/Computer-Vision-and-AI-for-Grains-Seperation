üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based system for grain separation. Traditional grain sorting methods are manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Our system leverages image processing, deep learning, and machine vision techniques to automate the identification and classification of grains based on size, colour, and quality.

The solution is designed to improve efficiency, reduce labor dependency, and enhance precision in agriculture, food processing, and quality inspection industries.

üß† System Design and Working

Image Acquisition

High-resolution cameras capture images of grains placed on a conveyor belt or flat surface.

Proper lighting ensures consistent image quality.

Preprocessing

Images are processed using OpenCV to remove noise, enhance contrast, and standardize backgrounds.

Segmentation techniques (thresholding, edge detection, contour extraction) isolate individual grains.

Feature Extraction

Extract visual features such as colour histograms, texture, shape, and size.

These features form the basis for classification.

AI Classification Model

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on labeled datasets of grains (e.g., wheat, rice, maize, lentils).

The model classifies grains into categories such as:

Type (e.g., rice, wheat, corn)

Quality (good, broken, damaged, infected)

Sorting Decision

Based on predictions, the system can trigger actuators (e.g., air jets, robotic arms) to separate grains into different bins.
